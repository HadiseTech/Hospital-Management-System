# Project Title: Global Kebele Managment System
# Project Describtion: 
When we search for problem that surround us we intended to look at our local kebele system.
As we know there is real problem in kebel still.because datas and other important information are kept in paper. so when some one come and need them there will be trouble in finding those datas. so anyone can't get all what he/she want at the time he/she want. there were also lots of beurocracy .so we tought that changing the paper work to online system is the only way to solve the problem.so generally speaking thise system will be desighned to change manual and traditional work of the kebele in to online and modern system.so any one will get all he/she want at any time easily.

The system will be global system that interconnect all the kebeles in the city further more in the country so it will controll some illegal activities like taking identification card from more than one kebele.

for example: when some one tries to take identification card from his kebele the system first check he haven't taken from other kebels.
