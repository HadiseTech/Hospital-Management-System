# Project Title: Local Kebele Managment System
# Project Describtion: When we search for problem that surround us we intended to look at our local kebele system.
                        as we know there is real problem in kebel still.because datas and other important information are kept in paper so when some one come and need them there will be trouble in finding them. so any can't get all what he/she want at the time he/she want. there were lots of beurocracy also.so we tought that changing the paper work too online system is the only way to resolve the problem.so generally speaking thise system will be desighned to change manual and traditional work of the kebele in to online and modern system.so any one will get all he/she want at any time he/she want.
#Feature of the project:
            our system will have the follwoing features:
                #Register All the Kebele People by grouping in family.
                #while registering include all the necessary information like birthdate,school(if he/she is student),workplace(if          she/he is worker),housenumber....etc
                #user will have thier own account
