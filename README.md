# Project Title: Local Kebele Managment System
# Project Describtion: 
When we search for problem that surround us we intended to look at our local kebele system.
As we know there is real problem in kebel still.because datas and other important information are kept in paper. so when some one come and need them there will be trouble in finding those datas. so anyone can't get all what he/she want at the time he/she want. there were also lots of beurocracy .so we tought that changing the paper work to online system is the only way to solve the problem.so generally speaking thise system will be desighned to change manual and traditional work of the kebele in to online and modern system.so any one will get all he/she want at any time easily.

# Feature of the project:
our system will have the follwoing features:
                # Register All the Kebele People by grouping in family.
                # while registering include all the necessary information like birthdate,school(if he/she is student),workplace(if          she/he is worker),housenumber....etc
                # user will have thier own account to get access from the system
                # user can send any complain to the kebele's admin directly.
                # user can take identification card from the kebele using thise system with out exiting physically.because they will do all the registration process at their home.
                # user can finish all the thigs regarding family issue like inheritance easily with these system.
                # user can take birth cirtificate and family death cirtificate too.
                # the system will post immediate notificationes on its home like remind the youthes to clean the kebele and also other immediate announcements.
